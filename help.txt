Running Application FAQ

	React or Flask are not pulling from each other
		- Restart frontend server by typing Ctrl + C then npm start
		- Restart backend server by typing Ctrl + C then python main/Templates.py

	Flask returns NOT FOUND
		- the example file stores data in /data so add /data at the end of server
		- ex. 127.0.0.1:5000/data

Routing
	Make sure you have installed react-router-dom
		$ npm install react-router-dom
	1. In App.js and between <Routes> add your page
		<Route path="/YOUR PATH" element={<YOUR APP FILE />} />
	2. Import your App file at the top of the page
		ex. import AppCal from "./calendar/AppCal";
	3. In Navbar <Link to="YOUR PATH">YOUR LINK TEXT</Link>
	
Building your User Story (React)
	- Organize your files by placing all related js files in the same folder
	- Importing .js files other files outside your code will automatically create pathname
		- Due to this avoid duplicate naming files
